# ACS 3320 - CSS Framework

## Description

The goal of this assignment is to create your CSS Framework.

### Why this assignment?

You might work on a larger scale project in the future. In a larger project you migth not know what needs to be styled in advance. Instead you'll want to make some general styles that can be used by your team to style pages that they will be creating. 

## Project requirements

Your framework should style these things:

- Text - Set the base font family, color, line height, and font size
  - Headers - h1-h6
  - Links - a, 1:hover, a:active, a:visited
  - Inline tags - strong, em, mark
  - Block quote
- Controls - form elements
  - input[text], input[email], input[password]
  - button
  - input[checkbox], input[radio]
- Navbar
- Footer

Your framework should be hosted on GitHub Pages. Follow this [guide](https://pages.github.com).

Your GitHub repo should have a README that documents your framework.

Take a look at this awesome list to see what other people are doing with CSS frameworks. Use this to get ideas of things you can do with your framework.
