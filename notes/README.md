# ACS 3320 Advanced CSS

This class is about you having fun with CSS. CSS is getting more powerful every year, the more you know, the more you can leverage its power!

Do not compare your art and design skills against anyone else. Just have fun and be creative!

## Week 1 – CSS Selectors & Specificity

**Assignment:** *CSS Zen Garden Remix*
Your goal is to redesign the CSS Zen Garden page.
**Rules:** You can only add CSS — you are not allowed to modify the HTML.
That means you must find selectors that identify elements since you can’t add new class names.

**Tuesday**
* Mastering selectors, specificity, pseudo-elements, inheritance.
* What is the CSS Zen Garden?
* Review Selectors – *CSS Diner*
* Explore Zen Garden
* Show examples

**Thursday**
* Pseudo-elements `::before` and `::after`
* CSS typography best practices
* Background image

## Week 2 – Drawing with CSS (Art & Composition)

**Assignment:** *Make a Picture with CSS*
Your goal is to create a picture with CSS.
**Rules:** You can only use HTML and CSS — no imported image files.
Your picture can be anything you like. Avoid preconceptions and worrying about what others will think — have fun!

**Tuesday**
* CSS positioning, transforms, gradients, clip-path
* Show some examples of what’s possible
* Clip-path generator
* Relative vs absolute position, z-index, and positioning context

**Thursday**
* CSS gradients and box-shadow
* Gradient syntax and relevant properties
* Gradient generator
* Box-shadow and stacking shadows
* When and why to use multiple shadows

## Week 3 – CSS Custom Properties

**Assignment:** *Parameterize Your Picture*
Take your Week 2 picture and refactor it to use **CSS custom properties**.
Use variables to define the colors, sizes, and positions of your elements.
**Goal:** Make your design themeable by changing only a few properties at the top of your CSS file.

**Tuesday**
* Using custom properties
* Setting defaults, fallbacks, and dynamic values

**Thursday**
* Scope and inheritance of custom properties
* Theming with `:root`, containers, and media queries

## **Week 4 – CSS Motion & Microinteractions**

**Assignment:** *Interactive Icon or Button Set*
Create three animated elements:

1. **Logo or progress timer** (looping keyframe animation)
2. **Button, icon, or link** that responds to both hover and active (click) states
3. **Triggered or timed animation** that plays from start to finish (like a loading bar, reveal, or notification)

**Tuesday**
* Transitions, keyframe animations, `@property`, easing functions

**Thursday**
* Combining custom properties with motion and interaction
* Accessibility considerations for animation (`prefers-reduced-motion`)

## **Week 5 – CSS Preprocessors (SASS)**

**Assignment:** *Design Tokens — Build-Time vs Run-Time*
Create a **theme system** that demonstrates the difference between SASS variables (compile-time) and CSS custom properties (run-time).
Use SASS to generate utility classes and design scales (spacing, color, typography), and CSS variables to implement runtime theming (light/dark modes).

**Tuesday**
* Variables, nesting, loops, partials
* Generating utility classes from maps and loops

**Thursday**
* Functions and mixins
* Comparing SASS variables vs CSS custom properties
* Building a small token system: SASS for structure, CSS vars for themes

## **Week 6 – Web Components & Scoped Styles**

**Assignment:** *Design a Custom Web Component with Lit*
Build a reusable, stylized component (e.g., `<ui-card>`, `<toast-message>`, or `<user-badge>`) using Lit.
Apply scoped CSS, animations, and theming with custom properties.

**Tuesday**
* Encapsulation, Shadow DOM, and style scoping
* How CSS variables penetrate Shadow DOM boundaries

**Thursday**
* Slots and component composition
* Reactive properties and dynamic styling
* Styling strategies for components in a design system

## **Week 7 – CSS Frameworks & Design Systems**

**Assignment:** *Build Your Own CSS Framework*
Start developing your own mini CSS framework that combines your work so far — SASS utilities, CSS custom properties, animations, and component styles.

**Tuesday**
* Framework architecture: folder structure, naming conventions, and build process
* Combining SASS + custom properties + utility classes
* Planning core utilities (layout, spacing, colors, typography)

**Thursday**
* Component-driven thinking
* Building documentation pages and live examples
* Accessibility and reduced-motion variants for your framework

## **Week 8 – Capstone: Brand + Motion System**

**Tuesday**
* Final assessment and code review
* Framework cleanup, documentation, and versioning

**Thursday**
* Present your CSS framework
* Peer review and showcase
