# ACS 3320 Web Components 

In this assignment you will study Web Components and create your own web component. 

Web Components are a new Web Technology that will be the future of Web Development. You may not have seen or used this before but I'm sure you will see more of this in the future! 

**First**, follow the guide here to get an idea of what web components are and how they work. These examples use vanilla JS. These do not use any external libraries. This is what the default technology is and how it works. 

There are several examples provided along with sample problems and solutions. Try as many of these as you can until you get an idea of how they work:

**Second**, try an example using Lit Element. Lit Element is a library that assists you in writing your Web Components. Understand that Lit Element is built on top the vanilla web components from the previous examples! 

This tutorial creates a todo list using Lit Element and Web Components.

**Third**, conceive of a web component of your own invention. You will write the code that defines this new component/s and submit that as your homework! 

You can use raw JS for this assignment or Lit its up to you. The Lit example linked above uses JavaScript but Lit can also be used with TypeScript (the syntax is a little different) feel free to use TypeScript if you like!

Here are a few ideas for web components that you might make: 

- Make a fancy animated button
- Make a custom check box or radio button
- Make an accordion UI element
- Make a tabbed UI view
- Make a carousel/slide show
- Make a custom text display that color codes or modifies the text contained in the source tag.
