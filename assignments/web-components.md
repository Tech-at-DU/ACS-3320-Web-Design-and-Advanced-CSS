# Web Components Assignment: HTML Custom Elements

## Overview

In this assignment, you will learn about web components and how to create reusable HTML Custom Elements. Web components allow you to encapsulate functionality and styles, making it easier to create modular and maintainable code. You will explore real-world applications of web components and create your own custom elements to enhance a web application.

## Goals

- Understand the concept of web components and their benefits in modern web development.
- Learn how to create and use HTML Custom Elements.
- Explore practical applications of web components in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

1. **Research Web Components**:
   - Investigate the definition and purpose of web components.
   - Read about the advantages of using web components in web development, including encapsulation, reusability, and interoperability.

2. **Select a Real-World Application**:
   - Consider applications of web components in real-world projects, such as:
     - Custom form elements (e.g., date pickers, sliders).
     - Reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, cards, modals).
     - Complex widgets (e.g., data tables, interactive charts).
     - Theming components for consistent styles across an application.

## Assignment Challenges

1. **Create Your Own HTML Custom Element**:
   - Choose a custom element to create based on the real-world applications discussed.
   - Implement the following:
     - **Encapsulation**: Ensure that your custom element encapsulates its styles and functionality.
     - **Attributes**: Allow customization of your component through attributes.
     - **Events**: Implement custom events to enable interaction with your component.

2. **Styling Your Custom Element**:
   - Use CSS to style your custom element. Consider how styles will be encapsulated to avoid conflicts with the global styles of the application.
   - Ensure your component is visually appealing and maintains a consistent look and feel.

3. **Integration into a Web Application**:
   - Create a simple web application or use an existing one to showcase your custom element.
   - Integrate your custom element into the application, demonstrating how it enhances functionality or user experience.

## Practical Applications

Here are some practical examples of how web components can be utilized:

- **Custom Form Elements**: Build a custom input field that validates user input or provides additional functionality, such as showing/hiding passwords.
- **UI Libraries**: Create a button component that can be reused throughout an application, with options for different styles and sizes.
- **Data Visualization**: Develop a chart or graph component that takes data as input and renders it in a user-friendly format.
- **Dynamic Modals**: Implement a modal component that can be triggered by different actions within the application and can display various content types.

## Submission Requirements

- Submit your HTML Custom Element code along with any necessary CSS and JavaScript.
- Provide a demonstration of your custom element within a simple web application.
- Include a brief report explaining your design choices, the challenges faced during implementation, and how you overcame them.

## Resources

- **MDN Web Docs**: [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) - Comprehensive guide on web components and custom elements.
- **Web Components.org**: [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/) - A community resource for web components, including libraries and tutorials.
- **Custom Elements Everywhere**: [Custom Elements](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/) - A resource for understanding how custom elements can be used across different frameworks.
