# Web Design Project

## Overview

In this assignment, you will either redesign a previous web project or create a new web page from scratch. This project focuses on enhancing your web design skills and applying best practices in layout, typography, color, and overall user experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Identify a Project**: 
   - Choose a previous web project that you feel could benefit from a redesign, or define a new web project that interests you.
   - Consider the purpose of the website, the target audience, and the key features you want to include.
   - Document your goals for the redesign or new design, outlining what improvements you aim to achieve.

2. **Define Project Requirements**:
   - List the essential elements your web page must include (e.g., navigation, content sections, footer).
   - Consider any specific functionalities or interactive elements you want to implement.

## Mocking Up Your Design

1. **Create Mockups**: 
   - Use design tools such as Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD to create high-fidelity mockups of your web page.
   - Focus on the overall layout, including headers, footers, content sections, and navigation.

2. **Iterate and Refine**: 
   - Share your mockups with peers for feedback and iterate based on their suggestions.
   - Ensure your design reflects a coherent visual style and aligns with your project goals.

## Challenges

As you work on your redesign or new web page, focus on the following challenges to improve your design:

1. **Typography**:
   - Choose a limited number of font families (ideally 2-3) that complement each other and enhance readability.
   - Pay attention to font sizes, line heights, and letter spacing. Ensure your text is easy to read across different devices.
   - Experiment with font weights and styles to create a visual hierarchy (headings vs. body text).

2. **Layout**:
   - Explore different layout techniques such as grid and flexbox to create a responsive design that adapts well to various screen sizes.
   - Consider the visual flow of your design; ensure users can navigate intuitively from one section to another.
   - Use whitespace effectively to separate elements and create a clean, uncluttered appearance.

3. **Color**:
   - Develop a cohesive color palette that reflects the brand or message of your website. Limit your palette to 3-5 main colors.
   - Consider color contrast for accessibility; ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors.
   - Use color to establish visual hierarchy and draw attention to key elements (buttons, headings, etc.).

4. **Imagery and Graphics**:
   - Select high-quality images and graphics that enhance your design and relate to the content.
   - Consider the use of icons for navigation or to illustrate concepts; ensure they are visually consistent.
   - Experiment with image placement, size, and alignment to create visual interest.

5. **User Experience (UX)**:
   - Think about the user journey; design with the end-user in mind, considering how they will interact with your page.
   - Ensure that navigation is clear and intuitive, allowing users to find information easily.
   - Test your design with potential users to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

6. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure your design is responsive and works well on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
   - Use media queries to adjust styles based on different screen sizes and orientations.
   - Test your design across multiple browsers and devices to ensure consistency and functionality.

7. **Accessibility**:
   - Keep accessibility in mind throughout your design process. Use semantic HTML and ensure that all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable.
   - Add alternative text for images and consider using ARIA attributes where necessary to enhance accessibility for screen readers.

Hereâ€™s a rubric for the redesign or new web page assignment, focusing on creativity, adherence to requirements, and the effective application of design principles:
